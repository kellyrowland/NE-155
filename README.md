For Homework 4, the files are run with the command "python *filename*", where *filename* is hw4\_6j.py,
hw4\_6gs.py, or hw4\_6sor.py (it is assumed that the user has Python installed on their system).

For Homework 5, the files are run with the command "python *filename*", where *filename* is hw5\_4j.py,
hw5\_4gs.py, or hw5\_4sor.py.

The output format for these files is:

number of iterations  
solution vector
error

The error is calculated as the absolute difference between the calculated solution vector and the result 
of using the NumPy solve function.
