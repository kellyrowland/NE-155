For Homework 4, the files are run with the command "python *filename*", where *filename* is hw4\_6j.py,
hw4\_6gs.py, or hw4\_6sor.py (it is assumed that the user has Python installed on their system).

For Homework 5, the files are run with the command "python *filename*", where *filename* is hw5\_4j.py,
hw5\_4gs.py, hw5\_4sor.py, or hw5\_4omega.py.

The output format for these files (except for the calculation of omega\_opt) is:

number of iterations  
solution vector  
error

The error is calculated as the absolute difference between the calculated solution vector and the result 
of using the NumPy solve function.

For the calculation of omega\_opt, the output is a plot of omega vs. number of iterations, called 
hw5\_omega.pdf.
